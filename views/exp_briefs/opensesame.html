    I was responsible for all front end development which involves taking designs/mockups/wireframes to fully functional UI
    for end users and to be compatible right across major browsers. Also did some back end work involving OO PHP, build new
    modules, maintain modules, code refactoring, optimization etc. One of my proud moments was developing a sub theme to
    integrate into one of the company's partners marketplace used by millions of users.
